# Feedback Form - reusable component for Backbone.js applications

That's a simple feedback form, which is being created as example of Backbone.js development for blog post series that I'm currently writing - [Baby steps to Backbone.js](http://www.beletsky.net/search/label/BabyStepsBackbone).

It's created with TDD and simplicity as development goals.

## Running up

`node app.js` - will start [backbone-server](https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/backbone-server), application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3002`.

## Running tests

At the moment, only browser-mode Jasmine runner at `http://localhost:3002/tests`.
